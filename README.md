# Binary-Classification-of-High-Grade-Glioma-and-Low-Grade-Glioma-Using-Deep-Learning
The classification of gliomas into high-grade and low-grade is crucial for determining the best possible treatment and prognosis. In this research study, a deep neural network-based method for the accurate classification of gliomas using MRI images is proposed. The dataset used for this study consisted of 369 patients with gliomas, including 262 patients with high-grade gliomas and 107 patients with low-grade gliomas. The dataset was preprocessed and augmented to reduce overfitting and improve generalization. To perform the classification task, a deep neural network architecture that consists of a convolutional neural network for feature extraction and a fully connected network for classification was demonstrated. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 99.7%, precision of 92%, and recall of 98.6% on a hold-out test set. These results demonstrate that the proposed deep neural network-based approach is effective in accurately classifying gliomas into high-grade and low-grade categories, which can aid clinicians in making appropriate treatment decisions.The proposed method has potential clinical applications in the early detection and classification of gliomas, which can improve the management and prognosis of patients with brain tumors. The deep neural network-based approach can help clinicians in making informed decisions regarding the best course of therapy, thereby improving patient outcomes. Overall, the results of this study indicate that deep learning-based approaches hold promise for the accurate classification of gliomas, and further research is warranted to evaluate their clinical utility.
