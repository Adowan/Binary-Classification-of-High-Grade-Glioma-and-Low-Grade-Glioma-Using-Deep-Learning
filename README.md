# Binary-Classification-of-High-Grade-Glioma-and-Low-Grade-Glioma-Using-Deep-Learning
The classification of gliomas into high-grade and low-grade is crucial for determining the best possible treatment and prognosis. In this research study, a deep neural network-based method for the accurate classification of gliomas using MRI images is proposed.
